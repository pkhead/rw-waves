- better info string
- session saves friendly creatures and objects in room
- make player lives number of current characters rather than available stock
  makes it so i don't have to add one for session saving I guess
- is it compatible with Myriad?
  i have commented places of the code where i use a hard-coded max player count. ctrl+shift+f "myriad".

- spawn configuration modes:
  - Preset: the spawn list that i created. does not care whether or not the user unlocked a creature.
  - Randomized: endless set of randomized creatures
  - Custom: user can customize spawns from the arena menu. can only add unlocked creatures.
            each wave will be represented by a big ass block. below is a sample of what one would look like.

            WAVE 1
            =================================
            [@]  (5)  [$]  (4)  [&]  (3)
            [%]  (2)  <+>

            Random: [(6), (8)]  <-- the square brackets and comma are as-is
            [@] (1) [$] (1) [&] (2) <+>
            =================================
            [               +               ]

            (symbols except the plus sign represent creature symbols)

- after every 10th wave, one of three randomly chosen events will happen:
  - give everyone an extra life
  - spawn 3-5 explosive spears
  - spawn 1-3 bombs

- BUG: life reloading on session reloadis buggy...
- BUG: FIGURE OUT WHY SOMETIMES CREATURES DONT SPAWN IN A WAVE SO IT CONTINUOUSLY INCREASES!!!
- BUG: Crouched down, stabbing a lizard, you grab a batfly, causes a crash
- BUG: I think when a lizard is in their den and is full they stay there forever but doesn't trigger the next wave
- BUG: Sometimes creatures will only come out of one den (idk why)
- BUG: lizards don't acknowledge player corpses if they died last round
