- better menu, also maybe spawn customizability?

- Multiplayer respawn options
    - Easy: All players respawn at the start of every round
    - Normal: Players only respawn if their body had been recovered
    - Hard: Players do not respawn

- Rework lives system?
    - Option: The multiplayer respawn option instead decides when they lose their life
    - Or should i keep the whole "attempts" system?

- Maybe Think about adding upgrades over time (idk how that would work tho...)

- BUG: Crouched down, stabbing a lizard, you grab a batfly, causes a crash
- BUG: I think when a lizard is in their den and is full they stay there forever but doesn't trigger the next wave
- BUG: Sometimes creatures will only come out of one den (idk why)
