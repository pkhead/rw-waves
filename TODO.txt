- better menu
- better info string
- player death ring thing doesn't show up after respawn
- show # of lives on corners
- is it compatible with Myriad?
  i have commented places of the code where i use a hard-coded max player count. ctrl+shift+f "myriad".

- Respawn Wait: Controls how many waves a player has to wait until respawning.
                Last value makes it so players only respawn once everyone is dead.

- Respawn Options:
    - Normal: When dead, players don't lose a life if their body hadn't been eaten. Respawn on next wave.
    - Hard: When dead, players always lose a life. Respawn on next wave.

- Maybe Think about adding upgrades over time (idk how that would work tho...)

- BUG: Crouched down, stabbing a lizard, you grab a batfly, causes a crash
- BUG: I think when a lizard is in their den and is full they stay there forever but doesn't trigger the next wave
- BUG: Sometimes creatures will only come out of one den (idk why)
